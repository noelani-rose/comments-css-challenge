            <p id = "ramsComm"><span id = "maxblagun">@maxblagun</span> If you're still new, I'd recommend focusing on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JS before considering React. It's very tempting to jump ahead but lay a solid foundation first.</p>

  @ramsesmiron <span id = "juliuComm">I couldn't agree more with this. Everything moves so fast and it always seems like everyone knows the newest library/framework. But the fundamentals are what stay constant.</span>
